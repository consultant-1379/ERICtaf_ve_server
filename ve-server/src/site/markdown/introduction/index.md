# Eiffel Visualization Engine (VE) Server

## Introduction
The Visualization Engine (VE) Server offers clients the ability to subscribe to live data directly from the Message Bus (MB) via websockets and to fetch historical data from the Event Repository (ER) via REST. The data retrieved from the VE server is used by the clients for visualization. The clients can also store and retrieve Dashboard and View configurations from the VE server, so that the client can restore any dashboard/view if a crash or disconnect occures.
