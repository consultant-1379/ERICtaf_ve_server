# Eiffel Visualization Engine (VE) Server

### Plugin architecture

The Eiffel VE server is extendable through a plugin API. This makes it possible to add custom models to the server to provide data to custom widgets in the VE client (or to other compliant clients). For more information on the API and how to create plugins, see link below.
